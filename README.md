**##Introduction##** 

The overall concept for this embryo API is to take restaurant orders from seated customers, send the orders to the kitchen for preparation and generate a bill at the end of the sitting. The system will be used by: table staff and kitchen staff. The Proof of Concept (POC)at this stage is for a restaurant API for taking food orders, sending the orders to the kitchen, and generating bills. The API takes orders from the restaurant-side by the waiter/waitress and sends the order to the server-side ordering terminal in the kitchen. The orders are printed out for the cooks.

The next stage of the API development will be to develop a tablet-based ordering system for take-away orders. Customers will use a tablet to place orders. The orders will generate a bill which the customer pays. The order is then sent to the kitchen for preparation.
